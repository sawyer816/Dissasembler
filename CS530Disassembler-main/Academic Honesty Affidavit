Group Programming Equitable Participation & Honesty Affidavit
We the undersigned promise that we have in good faith attempted to follow the principles of pair programming. 
Although we were free to discuss ideas with others, the implementation is our own. 
Furthermore, any non programming portions of the assignment were done independently. 
We recognize that should this not be the case, we will be subject to penalties as outlined in the course syllabus.
